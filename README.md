## AI4EO - Enhanced Agriculture challenge
The task is to provide a *cultivated or not* map (binary classification) at a higher resolution (2.5m) than the input Sentinel-2 SITS (10m). The data belongs to Slovenia country.

## LandCoverNet  - Europe
The task is to provide a land-cover map (a classification based on 7 classes) at 10m resolution. The data is global but distributed in different regions where we executed the assessment: Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America.
